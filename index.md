## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sergio-salgado.jpg" width="200" height="300">

I am Assistant Professor of Finance at the [Wharton School](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/), [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/).

I received my PhD from the [Department of Economics](https://cla.umn.edu/economics) at the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/)

## Working Papers

1. [Technical Change and Entrepreneurship](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qo6e47vfj0q57gy/SSalgado_ETC_2020.pdf?dl=0) (July 2020, revise & resubmit, *American Economic Review*)\
**Abstract.** I document a significant decline in the share of entrepreneurs among US households over the last three decades. Most of this decline is accounted for by a drop in the share of entrepreneurs among college graduates. Using a standard entrepreneurial choice model with two skill groups—high- and low-skill individuals—I then argue that the decline is the outcome of two technological forces that have increased the returns to high-skill labor: the skill-biased technical change and the decrease in the price of capital. I find that these two forces account for three-quarters of the decline in the share of entrepreneurs.

2. [Skewed Business Cycles](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ssv13bfz5yyhn3d/SGB_Firm_Skew_2020_sub.pdf?dl=0) (April 2020, revise & resubmit, *Quarterly Journal of Economics*)\
With Fatih Guvenen and Nicholas Bloom\
[Replication of Empirical Results](https://www.dropbox.com/home/FIRM_SKEWNESS_205/data/PlotsSep2018/SBC-Replication)\
**Abstract.** Using firm-level panel data from the US Census Bureau and almost fifty other countries, we show that the skewness of the growth rates of employment, sales, and productivity is procyclical. In particular, these distributions display a large left tail of negative growth rates during recessions and a large right tail of positive growth rates during booms. We find similar results at the industry level: industries with falling growth rates see more left-skewed growth rates of firm sales, employment, and productivity. We then build a heterogeneous-agents model in which entrepreneurs face shocks with time-varying skewness that matches the firm-level distributions we document for the United States. Our quantitative results show that a negative shock to the skewness of firms’ productivity growth (keeping the mean and variance constant) generates a persistent drop in output, investment, hiring, and consumption. This suggests the rising risk of large negative firm-level shocks could be an important factor driving recessions.
