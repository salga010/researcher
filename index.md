## Working Papers

1. [Technical Change and Entrepreneurship](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qo6e47vfj0q57gy/SSalgado_ETC_2020.pdf?dl=0) (revise & resubmit, *American Economic Review*)\
**Abstract**. I document a significant decline in the share of entrepreneurs among US households over the last three decades. Most of this decline is accounted for by a drop in the share of entrepreneurs among college graduates. Using a standard entrepreneurial choice model with two skill groups—high- and low-skill individuals—I then argue that the decline is the outcome of two technological forces that have increased the returns to high-skill labor: the skill-biased technical change and the decrease in the price of capital. I find that these two forces account for three-quarters of the decline in the share of entrepreneurs. {text-align: justify}</style>
